# Javascript
Used an async function to fetch the JSON file, then used a loop to render a template literal using insertAdjacentHTML.  Used a loop so if more programs were added to the JSON file they would render too. Also added the image URLS to the JSON file. 

# CSS
Used flexbox for responsiveness and media queries to decrease padding and font size for tablet and mobile view. 

# Potential Improvements 
-Add a nav hamburger on mobile view <br />
-Add a loading spinner that renders before the API call completes
